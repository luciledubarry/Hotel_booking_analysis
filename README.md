Evaluation of the course Python for Data Science: Hotel Booking Cancellations Analysis

Website: https://smellydatascience.com/teaching/python-for-data-science/evaluation

Context
- A hotel chain wants to identify signs that can help foretell if guests are going to cancel their room bookings. By doing so, they can better anticipate the occurrence of such events and adjust their room prices and cancellation policies accordingly.

Questions
- What is the proportion of cancelations in the dataset?
- How are the different variables (hotel type, market segment, customer type, etc.) distributed in the dataset?
- How do variables interact with each other?
- Are stay in nights distributed similarly accross market segments? customer types? countries? etc.
- Are stay in nights, customer types, etc. distributed similarly for different periods (months) of the year? per room type? etc.
- What variables are associated the most with booking cancellations?
- Build a simple machine learning classification model that predicts if a guest will cancel their booking or not.
